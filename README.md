# Sales-Prediction-using-Python
Welcome to my Data Science Internship at CodSoft! In this repository, you will find a Sales Prediction Project by using Python, that I have completed during
my internship at Codsoft. This project showcases my skills in Data Science, Python, matplotlib and problem-solving. Below is a summary of the projects:

This project focuses on predicting sales for a business. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of a predictive model
to forecast future sales.

In this Project, I have used a Sales Dataset to develop a model that can classify Sales of the TV, Radio, Newspaper.

In businesses that offer products or services. They utilize machine learning techniques in Python to analyze and Interpret Data.
